This is my test website, where I am learning the MEAN framework (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js), and
trying to make what I learn into a cohesive website. It is based on the MEAN.JS boilerplate website, except with my own
code and without modules. Maybe someday it will go somewhere, and become a production website, but until then, it looks
close enough to the boilerplate that I won't mind you looking and pulling for use in your own sites.
